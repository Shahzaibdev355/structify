PUTER (Perceptual Understanding and Transformation Engine for Rooms) is a sophisticated AI system integrated into Structify that specializes in understanding spatial layouts from visual inputs.

**How it Enhances Structify:**
- 🧠 **Intelligent Recognition** - Understands complex room configurations and architectural elements
- 🎯 **High Accuracy** - Recognizes various drawing styles, from rough sketches to detailed plans
- 📈 **Scalability** - Processes maps of any size, from single rooms to multi-story buildings
- 🔌 **Seamless Integration** - Works transparently in the background for a smooth user experience

**In Simple Terms:** Think of PUTER as an expert architect who can look at any sketch and instantly understand what it represents, then translate that understanding into a digital format computers can work with.
